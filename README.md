A simple tool for changing the label and the icon of a volume in Windows. It makes these changes by creating an `autorun.inf` file (or edits the existing one) on the volume you want to change its label and icon. 

## ✨ Features
- When selecting a volume, it checks if `autorun.inf` is present on it. It then retrieves its actual label and icon, so you don't have to type the same label if you only want to change the volume's icon or select the same icon if you only want to change the volume's label.

- Multiple icon options: default icon, custom icon (`.ico` or from an `.exe`, `.dll` or `.icl` file) or icon from image (converts the selected image to an `.ico` file).

- Option to hide the `autorun.inf` file and the `vl_icon` folder (the icon is stored in that folder).

- Option to backup the `autorun.inf` file for easily restoring it later if something wents wrong or you want to revert your changes to a previous point.

- Option to get rid of all customizations (including the ones not made by Volume Labeler).

- Option in the volumes' right click context menu for easily customizing volumes (available only in the classic context menu at the moment). 

- Light and dark themes and localization support.

## ▶️ Running from source
Before running from the source, you must install the dependencies. To do that, open Command Prompt in the folder of the cloned repository and run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that, open the `main.pyw` file.

## 🏗️ Building

### Building the app
Just run `build_app.bat`. It will do everything needed to build the app. After the build process is done, you can find the built app in a `build` folder (or in a `dist` folder if the renaming process fails).

### Building the installer
Before building the installer, you must install Inno Setup Compiler on your computer. You can download it [here](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php/).

Also, you must build the app first before building the installer. After building the app, make sure a `build` folder appears. If it doesn't and appears a `dist` folder intstead, rename that folder to `build`. After that, right-click `build_installer.iss` and choose `Compile`. After the installer was built, you can find it in the same `build` folder.
